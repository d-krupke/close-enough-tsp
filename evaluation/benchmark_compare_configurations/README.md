# A Benchmark for comparing the different configurations

The algorithm has a very generic implementation and will perform very differently depending on the configuration.
Some configurations will actually mimic the behavior of existing algorithms, we want to beat.
This benchmark will allow us to compare the performance of these different configurations.

The configurations to be compared are defined in `./configurations.json`.
The instances are collected in `./instances.json.zip`.
You can add your own configurations and instances to these files at any time,
and just run the benchmark again to compare them.
The script is smart enough to detect which configurations and instances are new and only run those.

The existing results in this folder were generated by the AlgRy workstations of our lab.
If you want to run the benchmark yourself, you should copy this folder and delete the `results` folder.
Then you can run the benchmark with `python3 00_run_benchmark.py`, after you installed cetsp_bnb and the projects`requirements.txt`.
This can be done by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and `pip3 install .` in the project root.
Make sure to run the benchmark in the benchmark folder so the results are stored in the correct folder.
